/*	This template is, perhaps, the most important template in the theme. It
	contains the main template layer that displays the header and footer of
	the forum, namely with main_above and main_below. It also contains the
	menu sub template, which appropriately displays the menu; the init sub
	template, which is there to set the theme up; (init can be missing.) and
	the linktree sub template, which sorts out the link tree.

	The init sub template should load any data and set any hardcoded options.

	The main_above sub template is what is shown above the main content, and
	should contain anything that should be shown up there.

	The main_below sub template, conversely, is shown after the main content.
	It should probably contain the copyright statement and some other things.

	The linktree sub template should display the link tree, using the data
	in the $context['linktree'] variable.

	The menu sub template should display all the relevant buttons the user
	wants and or needs.

	For more information on the templating system, please see the site at:
	https://www.simplemachines.org/
